<h1>The Best Movies According to Rafael</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies/series</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Game of Thrones</h3>
<p>My favorite series without a doubt. A perfect series with an imperfect ending.</p>

<h3>The Lord of The Rings (Trilogy)</h3>
<p>Legendary in every sense.</p>

<h3>Dragon Ball</h3>
<p>My favorite anime series. It is not above or below any other, it could not be in the top and be top 1 without any problem. The childhood of many and the life of others.</p>
